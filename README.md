The actual Swagger spec is beyond the scope of this package. All Swaggervel does is package up swagger-php and swagger-ui in a Laravel-friendly fashion, and tries to make it easy to serve. For info on how to use swagger-php [look here](http://zircote.com/swagger-php/). For good examples of swagger-php in action [look here](https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php/tree/master/Examples/Petstore).
